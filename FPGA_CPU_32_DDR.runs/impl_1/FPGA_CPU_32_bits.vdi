INFO: [Place 46-3] During incremental compilation, routing data from the original checkpoint is applied during place_design. As a result, dangling route segments and route conflicts may appear in the post place_design implementation due to changes between the original and incremental netlists. These routes can be ignored as they will be subsequently resolved by route_design. This issue will be cleaned up automatically in place_design in a future software release.

WARNING: [DRC PDCN-1569] LUT equation term check: Used physical LUT pin 'A2' of cell dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1 (pin dbg_hub/inst/BSCANID.u_xsdbm_id/SWITCH_N_EXT_BSCAN.bscan_switch/temp_curid[31]_i_1/I1) is not included in the LUT equation: 'O6=(A3*A6)+(A3*(~A6)*(~A1))+((~A3))'. If this cell is a user instantiated LUT in the design, please remove connectivity to the pin or change the equation and/or INIT string of the LUT to prevent this issue. If the cell is inferred or IP created LUT, please regenerate the IP and/or resynthesize the design to attempt to correct the issue.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
