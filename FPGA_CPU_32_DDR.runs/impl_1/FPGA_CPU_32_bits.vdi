WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2/O, cell r_LED_Bytes_reg[5]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC REQP-1709] Clock output buffering: PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of mem_read_write/ddr2_control/mig_7series_0/u_mig_7series_0_mig/u_ddr2_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
